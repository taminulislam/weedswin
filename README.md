## Abstract
Weed detection and classification using computer vision and deep learning techniques have emerged as crucial tools for precision agriculture, offering automated solutions for sustainable farming practices. This study presents a comprehensive approach to weed identification across multiple growth stages, addressing the challenges of detecting and classifying diverse weed species throughout their developmental cycles. We introduce two extensive datasets: the Alpha Weed Dataset (AWD) with 203,567 images and the Beta Weed Dataset (BWD) with 120,341 images, collectively documenting 16 prevalent weed species across 11 growth stages. The datasets were preprocessed using both traditional computer vision techniques and the advanced SAM-2 model, ensuring high-quality annotations with segmentation masks and precise bounding boxes. Our research evaluates several state-of-the-art object detection architectures, including DINO Transformer (with ResNet-101 and Swin backbones), Detection Transformer (DETR), EfficientNet B4, YOLO v8, and RetinaNet. Additionally, we propose a novel WeedSwin Transformer architecture specifically designed to address the unique challenges of weed detection, such as complex morphological variations and overlapping vegetation patterns. Through rigorous experimentation, WeedSwin demonstrated superior performance, achieving 0.993 ± 0.004 mAP and 0.985 mAR while maintaining practical processing speeds of 218.27 FPS, outperforming existing architectures across various metrics. The comprehensive evaluation across different growth stages reveals the robustness of our approach, particularly in detecting challenging "driver weeds" that significantly impact agricultural productivity. By providing accurate, automated weed identification capabilities, this research establishes a foundation for more efficient and environmentally sustainable weed management practices. The demonstrated success of the WeedSwin architecture, combined with our extensive temporal datasets, represents a significant advancement in agricultural computer vision, supporting the evolution of precision farming techniques while promoting reduced herbicide usage and improved crop management efficiency.

## Getting Started

### WeedSwin Installation

**Step 1: Clone the WeedSwin repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/taminulislam/weeds.git
cd weeds
```

**Step 2: Environment Setup:**

Create and activate a new conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n weedswin python=3.8
conda activate weedswin
```

Install PyTorch and CUDA:

```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

Install MMDetection and dependencies:

```bash
pip install -U openmim
mim install mmengine
mim install "mmcv>=2.0.0"
mim install "mmdet>=3.0.0"
```

Install additional packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3: Verify Installation:**

```bash
python -c "import torch, mmcv, mmdet; print(torch.__version__, mmcv.__version__, mmdet.__version__)"
```

### Training WeedSwin

Train the model using the provided configuration:

```bash
python train_weedswin.py
```

Or use MMDetection's training script:

```bash
python tools/train.py configs/weedswin.py
```

### Testing WeedSwin

Test the trained model:

```bash
python test_weedswin.py --checkpoint work_dirs/weedswin/epoch_12.pth
```

Or use MMDetection's testing script:

```bash
python tools/test.py configs/weedswin.py work_dirs/weedswin/epoch_12.pth
```

### Model Architecture

WeedSwin combines:
- **Swin Transformer backbone** (depths=[2, 2, 18, 4], embed_dims=192)
- **DINO detection head** with 4-scale features
- **174 weed classes** covering 16 species across 11 growth stages

Key features:
- Multi-scale feature extraction with hierarchical architecture
- Deformable attention for efficient processing
- Optimized for 218.27 FPS inference speed
- Achieves 0.993 ± 0.004 mAP

### Dataset Format

WeedSwin uses COCO format for annotations. Organize your dataset as follows:

```
data/
├── annotations/
│   ├── train.json
│   ├── val.json
│   └── test.json
├── train/
│   └── *.jpg
├── val/
│   └── *.jpg
└── test/
    └── *.jpg
```

Update the `data_root` path in [configs/weedswin.py](configs/weedswin.py) to point to your dataset location.
